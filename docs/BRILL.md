# BRILL

♐BRILL is a series of videos that was uploaded to the first and second
YouTube accounts between February 14 and March 9, 2016. The original
youtube account was suspended on February 25th, after more than
twenty-nine thousand BRILL videos were posted. The series began with
♐[BRILL B](BRILL_B "wikilink"), then began with numbered videos
counting up from ♐BRILL 0. (the last was ♐BRILL 29273.) The second
youtube account, after posting ♐[RELOCK](RELOCK "wikilink"), ♐[BRILL
49999](BRILL_49999 "wikilink") and ♐[N\* BRILL](N*_BRILL "wikilink"),
resumed from ♐BRILL 49999 (a "regular" BRILL video different than
♐[BRILL 49999](BRILL_49999 "wikilink")) and continued to ♐BRILL 50099.

## Relationship to special ♐BRILL videos and to ♐BRINE

*is ♐[N\* BRILL](N*_BRILL "wikilink") a compilation of the individual
videos? Do the ♐[BRINE](BRINE "wikilink") videos, which create a similar
composite, have the same data? This requires further investigation.*

Definitely worth checking out.
