| 2015-03-30 | The original youtube account is created. ([source](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-unsettling-mystery-of-the-creepiest-channel-on-youtube))                                                                                                                     |
| 2015-04-05 | The first known UFSC video (♐980708) was posted. This marks the beginning of the [original unnamed series](Original_unnamed_series). All 1247 videos posted this day are silent. |
| 2015-04-21 | /u/McSweepyPants argues that this ends the first "season" (i.e. videos related to each other via background colors, and other factors such as sounds). From April 5th to April 21st the videos are characterised by having far less talking than videos proceeding them. |
| 2015-05-26 | This "season" has the voice only speaking either 1 or 0 as far as can be determined - although note that this has happened in the previous season, but not very often.                                                                                                   |
| 2015-06-12 | Season seems to have a lot of microphone fumbling. Some unusually "personal" noises too, such as possible microphone flicking or heartbeat.                                                                                                                              |
