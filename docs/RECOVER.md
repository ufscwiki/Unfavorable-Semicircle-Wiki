## Description of video

The video is 0:07 in duration. The visuals contain black and white
horizontal lines before a flickering series of vertical lines (first
black and white, later blue and cyan.)

the audio is a stereo track with totally separate information in each
channel. The left has a "lockgroove" sound, like a record needle, which
appears to be the same sound repeated 3 2/3rds times (the file ends
during the 4th repetition). The right channel has two "pure" tones,
similar to data or test tones. The second, higher one has a significant
amount of [DC offset](DC_offset "wikilink").

## Composite

A composite of the various frames illustrates how the lines are
continuous with each other.
