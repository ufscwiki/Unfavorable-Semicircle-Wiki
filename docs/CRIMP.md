## Description of video
The video is 1:34 in length. The visuals contain a series of white
shapes on a black background. Unusually, the audio is "synced" to the
visuals (*i.e.* the soundtrack is quiet while the screen is static.)

## Audio analysis
The audio track is highly amplified like many other videos and has a
motor like with a clicking noise every repeating several times per
second.

## Composites

Perhaps the names of these videos ("crimp" or "to compress" and "recover" or "return to original state") imply a similar dynamic to that of [♐LOCK](LOCK "wikilink")-[♐DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink")-[♐RELOCK](RELOCK "wikilink").
