reddit thread. Some of these have been discussed further or have
possibly been tentatively dismissed on other threads.*)

## Successful ideas

  - Combining frames into [composites](Video_Composites "wikilink")
    (this began with ♐[RELOCK](RELOCK "wikilink") and has been
    subsequently applied to most videos)
  - Creating [3D Composites](3D_Composite "wikilink") from the
    composites. The clearest example is with
    [BREADTH](BREADTH "wikilink"), it is unclear whether any others are
    meant to be viewed this way.
  - digging through recordings on [wax cylinder](http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/index.php) and [78 rpm records](http://adp.library.ucsb.edu/) to identify the song in
    ♐[RETIO](RETIO "wikilink"). **UPDATE:** The song has tentatively
    been identified as the 1922 recording of "Away Down East In Maine"
    by Miss Patricola with the Virginians.
  - efforts have been made to [reverse engineer](Reverse_Engineering_Attempts "wikilink") the videos, or to
    understand the process by building new videos "from the ground up".

## Needing further investigation

Below is a short list of things that have been tried/discussed, feel
free to revisit these or use them as a starting point.

  - creating [XOR](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_3 "wikilink") composites (such
    as was done with ♐[FOND](FOND "wikilink"))
  - finding a common method of pitch shifting and/or speeding up/slowing
    down videos (so far this hasn't shown any interesting results, but
    isn't something that should be ruled out)
  - discovering if images are viable as Piet Code. Piet is a [graphical programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Piet).
    It uses images that are vaguely similar to UFSC images. An [effort was made](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/48n3p0/ufsc_attempting_to_run_delock_as_a_piet_code/)
    to run ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") as Piet, but it didn't go too
    far
  - analysis of frame durations [was done](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/48gv41/analysis_of_delock_image_durations/)
    on ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink").
  - furthering work with [bulk transcription](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/48slsm/partial_bulk_transcription_of_numbered_videos/)
    of the audio (such as was done with ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink")) and
    finding ways to analyze the results
  - finding if composites or other images could be related to [4D color barcodes](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/49s59l/patent_4d_color_barcode_for_high_capacity_data/)
    used for high capacity data encoding and decoding
  - [analyzing audio for encoded data streams](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4b3c5n/theory_audio_is_fsk_encoded_data_stream/)
    (such as FSK)
  - investigating further if ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") is related to
    Brill tagging or the [Brill Building Sound](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4bpzpl/the_brill_building_sound_by_1962_the_brill/)
  - analyzing anagrams: there have been many threads on anagrams, with
    no substantial results
  - working to discover the very meaning of the phrase *Unfavorable
    Semicircle*
  - analyzing ♐[CAB](CAB "wikilink") videos ([for .cab files](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4c7822/all_cab_videos_zip_file/))
    or embedded audible binary
  - applying further analysis to the composites to confirm if they are
    indeed different images of the same thing (possibly at different
    zoom levels)
  - interpreting the message in ♐[CREM](CREM "wikilink")
  - analyzing existing data to confirm the linkages between them.
    (*i.e.* how, precisely do the short and long
    ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") videos relate? Are they the same frames
    repackaged? Are ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") and
    ♐[BRINE](BRINE "wikilink") similarly related?)
  - reverse-engineering the process used to create the distortion and
    other audio effects in the UFSC videos; finding if there is a reason
    for the use of [DC offset](DC_offset "wikilink") and other
    unorthodox audio engineering techniques
  - figuring out how deliberate encoding errors (found in
    ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT "wikilink") and many more videos) are being
    introduced to the videos
  - It has been demonstrated that the ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH "wikilink") videos
    contain 100 discrete sounds, and they seem to be sounds recycled
    from other videos. Further analysis is needed to find out more about
    these sounds: can they be assembled into one continuous message? Is
    the use of 100 pieces a sign of a code or hidden puzzle?
  - ♐[FOND](FOND "wikilink") videos are listed on youtube with a length
    of 27:45. But they play as video (and open in Audacity) with a
    length of 23:45. Do these videos have three "hidden" minutes like in
    ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT "wikilink")?
  - Some videos appear to have identical sounds to previously-posted
    videos when they are sped up or slowed down. (*e.g.*
    ♐[LOCUS](LOCUS "wikilink")'s soundtrack transforms into data
    transmission-type sounds when sped up several hundred times.) Is
    this the same audio that is in other videos? What is the
    significance of this?
  - Verifying exactly where the Lame 3.99.5 tags on
    [LOVE](LOVE "wikilink") are coming from. Checking if other videos
    have them.
  - Studying which dates and times UFSC uses to upload his content and
    seeing if any pattern emerges
  - Creating 3D composites of interesting sections of an image (like
    with [HARVEST](HARVEST "wikilink")).
  - Layering composites of videos over each other
  - Discord user Parogar found [a selfie-type image](Spokeo_selfie "wikilink") (via spokeo.com) allegedly
    associated with the email unfavorablesemicircle@gmail.com
