# STEM
♐STEM is a video posted to the second youtube account on December 7,
2016. It was posted a day after the second (and last) video in the
♐[BREADTH](BREADTH) series.

## Description of video
The video is 9:15:33 seconds in length. The visuals contain a series of
flashing frames. There is no audio.

## Significance of name
The name doesn't seem particularly related to any of the [more esoteric meanings of the word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem). Regarding the
generic context of "stems" and "branches" it is somewhat suggestive, but
that gives no clear meaning.
