## Audio
The audio track contains a constant, very loud stream of sounds. Discord user Unstable Olding notes that "it seems like a combination of PORT, RETIO and the voice used in DEPTH".

> ben's fractals: The audio in COEF sounds like someone playing with the delay time of a high-feedback comb filter(or delay)
>
> Because at many points it goes to that annoying high pitch frequency probably meaning that Unfavourable semicircle reached the min. possible delay time for it
>
> I'm gonna do a quick example in FL studio
>
> Not exactly very close but it's sort of there - 4 different comb filters on top of one another where i change the frequency of them in realtime
