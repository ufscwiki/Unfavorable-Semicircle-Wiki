# Astrology

Unfavorable Semicircle used ♐, the astrological symbol (or glyph) for [Sagittarius](Sagittarius) to prefix nearly all video names.

[Stabilitory Newing](Stabilitory_newing) used ⊕, the astrological glyph for [Earth](Earth) to prefix nearly video names. 

No other explicit astrology symbols or terms are used in the videos, but it is a recurring source of speculation as to whether astrological concepts could be a method to find patterns or meanings in UFSC.

## Observations by Discord user Raketemensch
Modern astrology avoids using judgmental words such as 'bad' or 'good' when interpreting an [astrological chart](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Chart), so 'Unfavorable' would not be used professionally, though it might be used as such by amateur astrologers or anyone not familiar with [modern Western astrology](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Modern_Astrology).

The term Semicircle has no real meaning in astrology. A semicircle could be an indirect reference to an [aspect](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Aspect), which are angles between two [planets](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Planet) or points on an astrological chart. Some aspects are considered 'unfavorable', but without any context such as the planets or points creating the aspect, the term has no real meaning. The 'semicircle' could be an astrological pun, since the [Semisquare](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Semi-Square) aspect is
traditionally seen to be 'unfavorable'.

### Possible astrological references
Any numbers in the NN°nn'nn" format, where 0\>NN\>30, and 0\>nn\>60. That's the format astrology uses for placement of planets in a sign. Any
references to planet names and specific angles. Any latitude/longitude/time references. You need these to calculate an astrological chart

(See discussion in the Discord's #solving channel on 2017-07-29).

## Possible links between USFC and astrology
The videos [DUAL](DUAL) and [BROTHER](BROTHER) could be oblique references to the zodiac sign [Gemini](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Gemini_Gemini), which is the sign in opposition to [Sagittarius](Sagittarius).

## Relating astrological signs to UFSC Videos
Discord users Anteater and Vomalhaut have made some connections between different videos and various astrological signs:
* [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(astrology)) = twins (*i.e.*, [brothers](BROTHER))
* Sagittarius (obvious from UFSC's use of ♐, the sign's astrological symbol)
* Virgo is associated with [harvest goddess mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(astrology)), which connects to [HARVEST](HARVEST)
* Pisces is symbolized by fish; [BRILL](BRILL) are [a kind of fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_(fish))

Interestingly, the "houses" of Gemini and Sagittarius, as well as those of Virgo and Pisces, are opposed to each other, drawing a series of connections.

[Answers](ANSWERS) describes a connection of Unfavorable Semicircle and [Stabilitory Newing](Stabilitory_newing):
> The two channels represented a combination of space and Earth communication.

Unfavorable Semicircle uses the ♐ Sagittarius (*archer*) symbol with an arrow; similar to the ♂️ male symbol with an arrow.

Stabilitory Newing uses the ⊕ astrological symbol for Earth (Mother Earth); which is similar to the ♀️ female symbol.

In ancient Greece the constellation of Sagittarius in the sky and its mythological archer coexisted with the female Earth goddess Gaia.
