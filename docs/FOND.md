# FOND

♐FOND is a series posted to the new youtube account between June 11 and
14, 2016. There are eight videos in the series.

## Details
The videos all have an identical theoretical length of 27:45. That time
is listed for them on youtube, but they play as video (and open in
Audacity) with a length of 23:45. It is unclear if there are three
"hidden" minutes like in ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT).

## Audio
It seems that the sound on all FOND videos is the same.

## Xor composite
Inspired by the reference to the ⊕ (xor) symbol in the [third G+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_3), Piecat has created an xored composite.

♐FOND xor composite:

The method is described as taking all of the videos in a series and
graphically xoring them using the exclusion mixing mode. The resulting
composite for ♐FOND has a consistent pattern of alternating 7- and 8-bit
strips (*i.e.* 7 pixels horizontal then 8 pixels horizontal of the same
color), whereas one might expect the result to be random. This indicates
the possibility there may be a file or or a message hidden in that
composite.

## 3D composite
Creating a 3-D composite reveals an inner structure:

## Theories on origin
Reddit user /u/FreezePond believes the video is named after him for the
fact that he was talking about "what if he had a video named after him"
and it was uploaded.
