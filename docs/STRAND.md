# STRAND

♐STRAND is a series of videos uploaded to the
[Twitter](Twitter "wikilink") account. It began on December 23rd, 2017
at 6:52 PM EST, ten days after the apparent end of
♐[SECOND](SECOND "wikilink"). This short series ended (or has paused)
at ♐STRAND 198, which was posted at 11:41 PM on December 23, 2017. 63
was skipped in the posting sequence. There would not be another series
until the posting of ♐[AZO](AZO "wikilink") in May 2018.

Like several UFSC series, this was posted close to a holiday. It would
be followed four days later by ♐[REVI](REVI "wikilink").
