♐ROOT was a single video (although the number trailing the title
suggested the start of a series) uploaded to the [3rd youtube channel](3rd_youtube_channel "wikilink"). It was posted on December
31st, 2018, 78 days after ♐[GEN](GEN "wikilink") was posted. This was
the final content posted on the channel before the [4th G+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_4 "wikilink") caused a re-appraisal of its
authenticity. Nothing else was posted to the channel until
♐[FORM](FORM "wikilink") 0 followed exactly a year later, on December
31, 2019.
