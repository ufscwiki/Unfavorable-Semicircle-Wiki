♐CAB is a series of videos that was uploaded to the twitter account on
March 26, 2016. It is the fourth series posted in the twitter account,
and a departure from the earlier ones. It was posted during a busy
period for UFSC that included ♐[ZUFCHO](ZUFCHO "wikilink"),
♐[LONE](LONE "wikilink"), ♐[WINGSET](WINGSET "wikilink"),
♐[RETIO](RETIO "wikilink") and ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT "wikilink") on the main
channel (as well as the ♐[MUL](MUL "wikilink") series on twitter).

The videos in this series differ from the "classic" UFSC style: they are
slightly longer at five seconds, and the [Unknown
Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") has been replaced by a series of
static-y bursts.

This series is fully preserved. A collection of the videos is available
[here](https://www.unfavorablesemicircle.com/files/ARCHIVE_VIDEO_CAB.zip).

## "It's Binary"

[Investigation
confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4c8jjk/its_binary/)
that the CAB files contained audible binary (*i.e.* were broken into
eight "bits" that were on or off). It was further observed that there
were nineteen distinct binary patterns.

An [online
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FllOeyy1GVwHB6AXcAHcHV5RTWfzRmc9wmlYG0BEa5E/edit#gid=0)
was created to document the transcription of the files.

What these bytes combine into is not yet known.

## Possible meanings

CAB is also an [archive file
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_\(file_format\)), although
it was determined that the data in these files does not conform to the
format. <sup>(citation needed)</sup>
