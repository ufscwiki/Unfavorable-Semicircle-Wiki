# RUN
♐RUN is a video posted to the [3rd youtube channel](3rd_youtube_channel) account on January 4, 2018. It
is 2:14:24 long and contains a series of moving images.

## Audio
The audio track begins with a clear handshake, and then around 9 seconds
of silence, before about 2 minutes and 14 seconds of loud audio. The
audio has a repeating electronic noise with other underlying sounds.
Beginning at around 48 seconds, an organ-like chord is audible and
changes tone throughout the rest of the audible track.

The audio of the [Handshake](Handshake) has been the subject
of [further analysis](Handshake#Analysis).

### Details in composite
Discord user Rutabaga has observed that (similar to
♐[PORT](PORT) and ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH) ) there are
Morse-like "dots and dashes" in the top left corner of the image.

Discord user ShadowMorphyn has decoded these as "IGMENADENDNNEGOEMOOM".

## 3D composites

[![RUN3d2.webp](RUN3d2.webp)](RUN3d2.full.webp)
[![RUN3d3.webp](RUN3d3.webp)](RUN3d3.full.webp)

The arrow-tip shape is similar to [Lock](LOCK).

## "Morse code"
Following on the analysis of dots and dashes in ♐[NODE](NODE) (which could be decoded as 7-bit ASCII), discord user NKC1982 made a preliminary analysis of the dots and dashes in the top left corner:
- The black/white pixel code in the top left of the RUN composite yielded some text, but nothing meaningful. Using my method of removing the leading black/white pair and ignoring extra bits got "DYL@Oe@hAb@ns@c\_oO" which I'm pretty sure is meaningless.
- Thinking the @ symbols may be spaces, I tried rotating each byte one bit right and got the following text: '2 4 1 79 1/7' including the quote marks.

## Possible Relation to Chicxulub Crater
![The composite compared to the gravity map of the crater, where right is facing north.](Panhandles.png)

The grayscale composite shows a distinct spiral-shaped area that is
shaded darker than the majority of the image. Some of the most
identifiable features of the composite are the "panhandle" and what
looks similar to a circular impact crater. The meteor that formed the
crater is said to have caused a mass extinction event about 66 million
years ago, a disastrous event possibly being the meaning behind the
vague but worrying title "RUN."
