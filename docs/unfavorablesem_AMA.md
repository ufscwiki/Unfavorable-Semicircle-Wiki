62.  What was being portrayed in LOVE?

63.  Your early videos showed signs of attempting to learn about Youtube's algorithms,  Android Stagefright / Mpeg exploits, and came out just as Youtube was facing the problems of ffmpeg. We never found anything malicious, can you tell us more about these early efforts?
