# CULLET

♐♐CULLET was a video posted to the "[OT](OT "wikilink")" youtube channel
on or around June 19, 2017. Because that channel was generally
considered to be a tribute or copycat channel before the [fourth G+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_4 "wikilink"), it did not receive as much
analysis on its release. It is one of two unique videos posted to that
account, the other being ♐♐[LOYAL](LOYAL "wikilink").
