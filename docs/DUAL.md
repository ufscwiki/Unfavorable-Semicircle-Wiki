This video or series has a composite with an "interesting" [video scope](Video_scopes "wikilink").

## Description of videos

Regular ♐DUAL videos are 1:06:40 (4,000 seconds) in length and contains
a series of rapidly-flashing frames.

## Audio

The audio is a dual mono track of a whirring machine sound (with [DC offset](DC_offset "wikilink")) in bursts lasting approximately 2 minutes
48 seconds. The pattern changes at the end. The
[Handshake](Handshake "wikilink") can be heard at the start and end of
the audio.

Discord user Risto notes:
> the whirring is composed of identical sections with a 'steppy line level' silence afterwards:

> Interestingly, the handshake doesn't have an offset:

The 3-D composite makes a roughly half-spherical shape, somewhat similar
to that of ♐[POINT](POINT "wikilink")'s 3-D composite. This (and other)
