# LOYAL
♐♐LOYAL was a video posted to the "[OT](OT "wikilink")" youtube channel on or around December 24, 2016. Because that channel was generally considered to be a tribute or copycat channel before the [fourth G+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_4 "wikilink"), it did not receive as much analysis on its release. It is one of two unique videos posted to that account, the other being ♐♐[CULLET](CULLET "wikilink").

## Description of video
♐♐LOYAL is 36:24 in length with a series of flashing frames. It has an
abrasive/crinkly audio track.

## Meaning of Name
There is no clear meaning, but this could be taken a a hint that this
channel is "loyal" to the actual creator(s) of UFSC.

## Composites
♐♐LOYAL composite by discord user Mark The Third.

## Audio
In November 2025 a song was found in the audio-track:
> N25_CT13: the sped up version of the audio sounds like awesome violin music

A day later Lukidot identified the song as the theme-song by composer Yasuharu Takanashi for the anime Fairy Tail, which aired from 2009 to 2019. Listen here, https://youtu.be/kIwmrk7LoDk?t=36s.
