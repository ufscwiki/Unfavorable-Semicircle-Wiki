# GOLDEN

♐GOLDEN is a video posted to the second youtube account on March 18,
2017. It was the first video posted after an almost two-week break on
the youtube account (♐[MOTH](MOTH) 55 was posted on March
4th) and the day before the start of the ♐[DUAL](DUAL)
series.

## Description of video

The video is 5:33:49 in length. It has a series of flashing frames that create a 2-D composite.

## Audio & analysis

Unusually, the audio is different as played on youtube than in a
downloaded version. The downloaded version has a high-pitched tone in
the background throughout that is not audible when watching on youtube.

## Significance of name and relationship to other videos

There was no agreement as to the significance of the title after it was posted. The "\_OLDTHOUGHT" [tweet](June_2022_twitter_posts) has linked it to the [Voyager Golden Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record).

## Composites

### 2-D Composite

The composite creates a grid with four different images, similar to ♐[HARVEST](HARVEST).

#### Significant data in the composite

##### Text in composite

Similar to ♐[HARVEST](HARVEST), it appears that there is text encoded at the bottom of the top right quadrant. The small size made the text difficult to decipher. However, with the posting of @unfavorablesem's version of the composite in 2022, discord user && has theorized that the text reads "THERE IS ALWAYS MORE THERE IS ALWAYS MORE..."

##### Similarity to ♐[RAPID](RAPID)?

The top-left quadrant has a schematic/wireframe look similar to
♐[RAPID](RAPID). It also looks possible that it can be
"folded" and re-aligned as with ♐[BROTHER](BROTHER).
