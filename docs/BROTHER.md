# BROTHER
## Overview
♐BROTHER is a series of videos uploaded to the second YouTube account.
♐BROTHER 0 was posted on September 23, 2016 (the same date as
♐[RECOVER](RECOVER)) and ♐BROTHER 15 was posted on October
5, 2016. After a short silence, the series was followed by
♐[HARVEST](HARVEST) on October 10, 2016. Although it was
assumed that set of sixteen videos meant the series was complete,
♐BROTHER 16 was posted on November 14, 2016.

⊕BROTHER is also the first series posted to the [Stabilitory newing](Stabilitory_newing) channel.

## Description of main channel videos
The videos have a duration of 6:05 (on youtube) and a series of
rapidly-flashing frames.

This series' videos also have a stereo audio track with different sounds
in L and R channels. (Discord user 59ekim has noted "the left channel is
a square wave merged with the right channel's audio"). The audio in
♐BROTHER 1 appears to be a more distorted version of the audio in
♐BROTHER 0. Further analysis is required on the audio in this series.

## 3D composite

## Significance of composite image
There appears to be an image of a flat key on the left side of the
composite; the shape to the right of it can be interpreted as a
three-dimensional object.

## Irregularities
- Two identical versions of ♐BROTHER 2 were uploaded eight hours apart.
- There was a gap of more than a month between ♐BROTHER 15 + ♐BROTHER 16

## Stabilitory newing series
[Stabilitory newing](Stabilitory_newing) posted 56 videos (0-55), titled with a leading ⊕. There may be some "fraternal" relationship between the two series.

### Description of Stabilitory newing videos
![Brother.jpeg](Brother.jpeg)

- Many of the Stabilitory newing videos have identical audio to each other
- Some of the audio produces French or English auto-generated subtitles on YouTube.
- ⊕BROTHER 55 seems to have issues playing past 1:39, despite having a length of 3 minutes.

### Auto-generated subtitles in Stabilitory newing BROTHER videos
Classification of audio based on the aforementioned French and English subtitles (⊕BROTHER X).
