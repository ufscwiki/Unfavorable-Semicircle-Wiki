November tweets*)

## Description of videos

The videos in this series are two seconds long, with rapidly-changing
frames of a single color and the [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice) making a series of sounds that are not
the customary letters and numbers. Pieces of the
[Handshake](Handshake) appear occasionally
([example](https://twitter.com/unfavorablesemi/status/743637589274464261))

This series is well-preserved, and all of the videos have been scraped.
Several composites have been made of the videos.

## Relationship with ♐[HARVEST](HARVEST)

The image in the DEPTH composite is visually similar to the top half of
the ♐[HARVEST](HARVEST) composite image. So far, no systemic
investigation has been made to determine whether they are exactly
similar. Likewise, it is otherwise unclear why or how the two series are
related.

## Sound analysis

The ♐DEPTH videos contains sounds that seem to be audio from other
videos chopped into smaller slices. (It has been theorized that includes
the audio from ♐[CREM](CREM) and ♐[ZUFCHO](ZUFCHO)
amongst others.)

[Initial analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4qpi6n/depth_videos_combined_interesting_audio/)
has indicated there are 100 discrete sounds used across the series, but
there is still work to be done finding the significance of that, such as
finding whether that comprises a codeset or if the pieces can be
arranged into a single continuous message.
