# ♐HARVEST

♐HARVEST is a video posted to the second youtube account on October 10,
2016. It was posted five days after the conclusion of the
♐[BROTHER](BROTHER "wikilink") series and a day before the beginning
the the ♐[SLIM](SLIM "wikilink") series.

It is noteworthy in that its composite image includes a string of text
from the [Wikipedia article on "Art"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art). (see below)

## Description of video

At 9:43:20, this is one of the longest videos posted by Unfavorable
Semicircle. The visuals contain a flickering series of colored frames.

The audio is a mono track with a variety of data transmission type
sounds throughout.

### Audio analysis

There is a sort of structure to the audio, with a series of "spikes"
that sound like there are LIMIT-style noises mixed in with the data
transmission sounds. It starts with the same log-on/log-off "handshake"
noise from the end of ♐[ZUFCHO](ZUFCHO "wikilink").

The [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") speaks the letter "B" (or
possibly "E") near the start and again a number of times throughout the
video (it could be at other places, especially inside the louder spikes,
but initial analysis has found the letter repeated at 0:06:58, 1:08:48,
3:21:15, 4:20:06, 4:44:33, 6:13:34, 6:20:32, 6:25:38, 6:33:04 and
6:38:52) — there is no obvious pattern to these repetitions. Immediately
after the "loud" section ending at 4:43, the voice counts from 0 to 9.

There is an "interlude" at 6:44:33 (preceded by a handshake/log-off
sound) of quieter wump/mic bump type noises that lasts approximately
three minutes and forty-five seconds.

There are also several unusual noises throughout the video, including a
"calliope"/♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") type noise at 0:13, 5:44:33, and
data transmission tics at 6:06:45.

Further analysis, especially within the "spikes" will probably reveal
further anomalies.

## Significance of name

Besides the obvious autumnal resonance of the name, it has been noted
that the video was posted on [Canadian
Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_\(Canada\)).

## Significance of Composite

The ♐HARVEST composite contains three "panels" — the top half is clearly
related to the ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH "wikilink") composite, although the bottom
half (and the relationship between the parts) is unknown.

The angled line in the lower right section is similar to the line in
♐[RECOVER](RECOVER "wikilink").

### Text in composite

It was discovered by thomasf that the lower area of the top right
"panel" contains contains tiny text (black, with green/gray outline
around it) which cites the beginning of the [Wikipedia page for
Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art):

punctuation than used in the composite*

It is possible that this is a straightforward message from the
creator(s) of Unfavorable Semicircle that the entire project is meant to
be considered as art — or this could merely be found text placed in the
image for some other unknown reason — possibly to demonstrate that the
project's videos can be used as a means to encode "text" messages.

If is worth noting that although the ♐HARVEST video was posted on
October 10th, the version of the text from the Wikipedia article changed
from the way it is reproduced in the composite on June 21st.

    less readable) section of text.**
